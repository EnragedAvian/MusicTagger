INSTRUCTIONS ON USING FINAL PRODUCT:
- 
Since the project requires access to a music library (either itunes or apple music), the software *must* be running on a physical device. Since the emulator has no library, the application will not work without being built on an iphone.
No additional components need to be installed to run this project.

The application itself allows the creation of user-defined tags to sort music and create playlists. In order to do so, one must first create tags from the "Manage Tags" menu. There, they can press the plus button in the upper right corner to create a new tag.
Once a tag has been created, the user can then add the tag to certain pieces of media. They can do so by pressing on the more info ellipses on any piece of media in the my Music tab and pressing the tag button on the subsequent detail view. There they can add or remove tags to that piece of content.
Finally, the user can generate a playlist based on those tags in the "New Playlist" section. There, they can select what tags they want to use to generate the playlist and can press the new playlist button in the upper right corner to generate the playlist. Upon pressing that button, a new playlist will be generated with all tagged media, ensuring that no piece of media is repeated twice even though it may have multiple tags.
